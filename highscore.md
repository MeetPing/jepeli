## how to get your highscore into the leaderboard

First get the highscore or score in general

Then go to [Issues](https://github.com/MeetPing/jpeli/issues) and make your highscore into your title and your firemember to hvrstname/nickname

import a video of yourself doing the highscore any edits of anykind is strictly prohibited and will get you banned from getting your name on the leaderboard

If you dont have a video then you have no proof of getting the highscore and you would remember to record the game
